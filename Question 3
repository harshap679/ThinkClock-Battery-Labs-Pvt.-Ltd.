Q3 — Pros & cons of the two battery topologies
Ans)
I examined the two images in your PDF: they show two ways of arranging multiple cells to achieve both required pack voltage and capacity. 
These are commonly described as combinations of series and parallel connections; the endpoints differ depending on whether cells are first 
connected in series then paralleled (or vice versa). Below are the general pros/cons that apply to the two pictured kinds.

Topology-1 (looks like many cells in a grid with small series strings paralleled across rows)
-(Interpretation): multiple strings of cells where each string is built from some number of cells in series, and those strings are paralleled to increase capacity/current capability.

Pros
-High current capability: Parallel strings share current; pack can deliver higher continuous current (current splits across parallel strings).
-Better total capacity: paralleling increases Ah (amp-hour) capacity linearly.
-Redundancy: if one cell in a parallel group fails open, the remaining parallel cells can still supply current (though pack voltage or capacity may be affected).
-Lower effective internal resistance: parallels reduce internal resistance, lowering losses and heat generation under load.

Cons
-Cell balancing complexity: cells in different parallel strings must be well matched. 
 If one string has different state-of-charge (SoC) or internal resistance, it may be overstressed.
-Failure propagation: a shorted cell in one parallel branch can draw heavy current from other parallel cells, causing damage unless protection exists.
-Thermal issues: uneven heating across strings can lead to local hotspots; requires careful thermal design and monitoring.
-BMS complexity: current sensing and cell balancing circuits need to handle parallel branches (sometimes per cell or per string balancing).


Topology-2 (looks like long series chains with some parallel taps — effectively series-first layout)
-(Interpretation): cells are arranged in longer series chains (to reach required voltage) with fewer or no parallel connections, or series chains that are paralleled but visually arranged differently.

Pros
-Higher pack voltage flexibility: series-first arrangement gets large voltages with fewer balancing groups if parallel count is small.
-Simpler per-cell balancing (per series chain): balancing circuits often connect per series string; 
 if there’s only one cell per series position, per-cell balancing is straightforward (standard BMS).
-Failure isolation in series: if one cell fails open in a long series string, the entire string fails 
 but doesn’t necessarily destroy parallel strings (depends on arrangement).

Cons
-Lower current capability if no parallels: single series strings limit pack current to one cell’s capability.
-Less redundancy: an open or failed cell in series causes the whole string to stop delivering the correct voltage unless there are redundant parallels.
-Balancing requirement: series chains must be actively balanced to keep all cells at equal SoC; otherwise weaker cells become over-stressed.
-Higher stress per cell when high current demanded: unless paralleled, each cell must carry full pack current — may need cells rated for higher C-rate.
-Practical tradeoffs & what engineers consider when choosing
-Application current demand: if you need high current → use more parallels (topology like Topology-1). 
 If you need high voltage with moderate current → series-first (topology like Topology-2) may suffice.
-Safety / reliability: paralleling adds some redundancy but requires smart protection against current hogging & shorts.
-BMS complexity: more parallels and many small groups require more complex balancing and more sensing channels.
-Manufacturing & matching: cells intended for parallel operation should be well-matched (capacity, internal resistance, age) at assembly.
-Thermal management: paralleling reduces per-cell I²R heating but can complicate thermal paths (cells may heat unevenly).

Concrete example
-If you build a 12S2P pack (12 cells in series, 2 in parallel each position), you get roughly double capacity and double current capability 
 vs a single 12S1P pack, but you must ensure parallel pairs are matched well and include short-circuit protection (fuses or FETs) and per-cell monitoring.


Or implement a non-blocking (timer-based) Pico program variant (so button presses are handled immediately and you can run other tasks concurrently).
